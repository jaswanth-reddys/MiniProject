# MiniProject: Image-Based Detection of Quality of Fruits and Vegetables Using AI

## Overview
This project develops an AI-driven system using computer vision techniques to detect the quality of fruits and vegetables. YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models are utilized for real-time classification of healthy and rotten produce. The system automates the quality assurance process, reduces human error, and enhances efficiency in the agricultural industry. Additionally, it assists in winemaking processes by evaluating the percentage of rotten produce.
